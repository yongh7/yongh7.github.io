### 2023 Oct 

So this month, I'm on a mini bulk, eating more but not really tracking my marocs/calories. I've packed on around 3 pounds. No idea if it's muscle, fat, or just water, but I do feel like I'm getting a bit stronger. Upper body routine's pretty much the same, but I've thrown in more dips, and my left shoulder's surprisingly not complaining as much. But the real deal is my lower body gameâ€”it's finally not getting skipped. Started stretching more and even spend some money to check my flexibility at StretchLab. Turns out my left side is kinda lagging, so I'm working on that. My mobility still needs work, so I've ditched back squats for now and I'm hitting the leg press and other dumbbell stuff. Fingers crossed, I'll sort out this ankle issue and get back to heavy squats soon!
