#### 2023 Oct 

So this month, I'm on a mini bulk, eating more but not really tracking my marocs/calories. I've packed on around 3 pounds (Now ~143 lbs). No idea if it's muscle, fat, or just water, but I do feel like I'm getting a bit stronger. Upper body routine's pretty much the same, but I've done more dips, and my left shoulder's surprisingly not complaining as much. I started stretching more, and my left side is kinda lagging but I'm working on that. I have to give up on back squats for now and I'm hitting the leg press and other dumbbell stuff. After I sort out this ankle issue I will get back to heavy squats soon!
