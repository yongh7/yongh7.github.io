#### Ski resorts I went to last season

##### Cali
1. Mammoth: Driving to mammoth is some experience.
2. Bear mountain: Driving to big bear is also some experience...
3. Snow summit: Jerrys go to snow summit.

##### Utah
1. Snowbird: The best ski resort?
2. Brighton: Almost broke my back.
3. Solitude: A blue run at solitude equals to a double black diamond at big bear.
